# week_72_Builder

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

- Most of the time, widgets in Flutter build without looking up any extra information about their parents. Sometimes, you might write some code where the <u>child widget needs to access the build context of a parent widget in the same build method</u>. That's what the Builder widget is for!
