# week_76_IgnorePointer

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

- It can be useful to prevent the user from interacting with parts of your app. When the UI changes under users' fingers, that's actually a pretty common and frustrating problem. You could address this problem by disabling all interactive elements in your app, one by one, or you could use IgnorePointer.
