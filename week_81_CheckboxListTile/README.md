# week_81_CheckboxListTile

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

- Whenever you accomplish something, it's rewarding to be able to check it off your list. There's never just one thing to do, though, and these check boxes usually come in a list. CheckboxListTile combines two widgets: Checkbox and ListTile, but instead of simply making the leading or trailing widget a checkbox, it also makes it so that tapping anywhere in the ListTile toggles the checkbox.
