# week_44_AnimatedPositioned

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

- AnimatedPositioned automatically transitions the child's position over a given duration whenever the given position changes. Directional properties are implemented, allowing your widget to grow and shrink as part of the animation! (Note: Only works if it's the child of a [Stack](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html). )
